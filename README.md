SNYK
Snyk is a platform that allows you to scan, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in your code, open-source dependencies, container images, and infrastructure as code configurations. The Snyk platform uses a risk-based approach, focusing security efforts on issues that matter, and eliminating the noise of vulnerabilities that have no meaningful impact.
